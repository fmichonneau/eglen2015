  author      = "Rodieck, R W",
  affiliation = "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington,
                 Seattle.",
  abstract    = "The density recovery profile is a plot of the spatial density
                 of a set of points as a function of the distance of each of
                 those points from all the others. It is based upon a
                 two-dimensional point autocorrelogram. If the points are
                 randomly distributed, then the profile is flat, with a value
                 equal to the mean spatial density. Thus, any deviation from
                 this value indicates that the presence of the object
                 represented by the point alters the probability of
                 encountering nearby objects of the same set. Increased value
                 near an object indicates clustering, decreased value near an
                 object indicates anticlustering. The method appears to be
                 unique in its ability to provide quantitative measures of the
                 anticlustered state. Two examples are presented. The first is
                 based upon a sample of the distribution of the somata of
                 starburst amacrine cells in the macaque retina; the second is
                 based upon the distribution of the terminal enlargements on
                 the dendrites of a single macaque ganglion cell that projects
                 to the superior colliculus. In both cases, the density
                 recovery profile is initially lower than the mean density, and
                 increases up to the plateau at the value of the mean density.
                 Two useful measures can be derived from this profile: an
                 intensive parameter termed the effective radius, which
                 quantifies the extent of the region of decreased probability
                 and is insensitive to random undersampling of the underlying
                 distribution, and an extensive parameter termed the packing
                 factor, which quantifies the degree of packing possible for a
                 given effective radius, and is insensitive to scaling. An
                 extension of this method, applicable to correlations between
                 two superimposed distributions, and based upon a
                 two-dimensional point cross-correlogram, is also described.",

  abstract    = "Mosaics of neurons are usually quantified by methods based on
                 nearest-neighbor distance (NND). The commonest indicator of
                 regularity has been the ratio of the mean NND to the standard
                 deviation, here termed the 'conformity ratio.' However, an
                 accurate baseline value of this ratio for bounded random
                 samples has never been determined; nor was its sampling
                 distribution known, making it impossible to test its
                 significance. Instead, significance was assessed from
                 goodness-of-fit to a Rayleigh distribution, or from another
                 ratio, that of the observed mean NND to an expected mean
                 predicted by theory, termed the dispersion index. Neither
                 approach allows for boundary effects that are common in
                 experimental mosaics. Equally common are 'missing' neurons,
                 whose effects on the statistics have not been studied. To
                 address these deficiencies, random patterns and real neuronal
                 mosaics were analyzed statistically. Ns independent
                 random-point samples of size Np were generated for 13 Np
                 values between 25 and 6400, where Ns x Np > or = 144,000.
                 Samples were generated with rectangular boundaries of aspect
                 ratio 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 to examine the influence of sample
                 geometry. NND distributions, conformity ratios, and dispersion
                 indices were computed for the resulting 45,997 independent
                 random patterns. From these, empirical sampling distributions
                 and critical values were determined. NND distributions for
                 small-to-medium, bounded, random populations were shown to
                 differ significantly from Rayleigh distributions. Thus,
                 goodness-of-fit tests are invalid for most experimental
                 mosaics. Charts are presented from which the significance of
                 conformity ratios or dispersion indices can be read directly.
                 The conformity ratio reacts conservatively to extremes of
                 sample geometry, and provides a useful and safe test. The
                 dispersion index is nonconservative, making its use
                 problematic. Tests based on the theoretical distribution of
                 the dispersion index are unreliable for all but the largest
                 samples. Random deletions were also made from 33 real retinal
                 ganglion cell mosaics. The mean NND, conformity ratio, and
                 dispersion index were determined for each original mosaic and
                 36 independent samples at each of nine sampling levels,
                 retaining between 90\% and 10\% of the original population. An
                 exclusion radius, based on a spatial autocorrelogram, was also
                 calculated for each of these 10,725 mosaic samples. The mean
                 NND was moderately insensitive to undersampling, rising
                 smoothly. The exclusion radius was remarkably insensitive. The
                 conformity ratio and dispersion index fell steeply, sometimes
                 failing to reach significance while half of the cells still
                 remained. For the same 33 original mosaics, linear regression
                 showed the exclusion radius to be 62 +/- 3\% of the mean NND.",

  abstract    = "Retinal neurons are often arranged as non-random distributions
                 called ``mosaics,'' as their somata minimize proximity to
                 neighboring cells of the same type. The horizontal cells serve
                 as an example of such a mosaic, but little is known about the
                 developmental mechanisms that underlie their patterning. To
                 identify genes involved in this process, we have used three
                 different spatial statistics to assess the patterning of the
                 horizontal cell mosaic across a panel of genetically distinct
                 recombinant inbred strains. To avoid the confounding effect of
                 cell density, which varies twofold across these different
                 strains, we computed the ``real/random regularity ratio,''
                 expressing the regularity of a mosaic relative to a randomly
                 distributed simulation of similarly sized cells. To test
                 whether this latter statistic better reflects the variation in
                 biological processes that contribute to horizontal cell
                 spacing, we subsequently compared the genomic linkage for each
                 of these two traits, the regularity index, and the real/random
                 regularity ratio, each computed from the distribution of
                 nearest neighbor (NN) distances and from the Voronoi domain
                 (VD) areas. Finally, we compared each of these analyses with
                 another index of patterning, the packing factor. Variation in
                 the regularity indexes, as well as their real/random
                 regularity ratios, and the packing factor, mapped quantitative
                 trait loci to the distal ends of Chromosomes 1 and 14. For the
                 NN and VD analyses, we found that the degree of linkage was
                 greater when using the real/random regularity ratio rather
                 than the respective regularity index. Using informatic
                 resources, we narrowed the list of prospective genes
                 positioned at these two intervals to a small collection of six
                 genes that warrant further investigation to determine their

                 no direct evidence that this was the case. In this study, we
                 show by light microscopy that labeled bipolar cells have
                 dendrites ending exclusively upon presumptive blue cones
                 labeled by Procion black dye. All blue cones were contacted by
                 labeled bipolar cells, and virtually all bipolar cells
                 contacted blue cones, the only exceptions being in regions
                 where blue cones had been lost. Approximately 20\% more
                 labeled bipolar cells than blue cones were found at every
                 eccentricity; thus, connections between blue cones and labeled
                 bipolar cells were not strictly one to one. The mean number of
                 cones presynaptic to each bipolar cell was 1.2, and the mean
                 number of bipolar cells postsynaptic to each cone was 1.8. By
                 an electron microscopic study of labeled bipolar cell
                 dendrites, we determined that they became central elements of
                 ribbon synapses in blue cones. Some of their ribbon synapses
                 were unusual: in one type, a single, large labeled dendrite
                 was postsynaptic to two or more ribbons, while in the other
                 type, ribbons had two or more central elements. The presence
                 of these invaginating contacts and the axonal terminals in the
                 proximal inner plexiform layer suggest that the labeled
                 bipolar cells depolarize to short-wavelength stimuli and
                 function to relay information from blue cones to the inner
                 plexiform layer. There were also other, unlabeled bipolar cell
                 dendrites that received inputs from blue cones at basal
                 junctions and triad-associated flat contacts, which suggests
                 that there are additional types of bipolar cells conveying
                 information from short-wavelength cones in the primate retina.",

  abstract    = "Beta retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the cat are classified
                 as either on-center or off-center, according to their response
                 to light. The cell bodies of these on- and off-center RGCs are
                 spatially distributed into regular patterns, known as retinal
                 mosaics. In this paper, we investigate the nature of spatial
                 dependencies between the positioning of on- and off-center
                 RGCs by analysing maps of RGCs and simulating these patterns.
                 We introduce principled approaches to parameter estimation,
                 along with likelihood-based techniques to evaluate different
                 hypotheses. Spatial constraints between cells within-type and
                 between-type are assumed to be controlled by two univariate
                 interaction functions and one bivariate interaction function.
                 By making different assumptions on the shape of the bivariate
                 interaction function, we can compare the hypothesis of
                 statistical independence against the alternative hypothesis of
                 functional independence, where interactions between type are
                 limited to preventing somal overlap. Our findings suggest that
                 the mosaics of on- and off-center beta RGCs are likely to be
                 generated assuming functional independence between the two
                 types. By contrast, allowing a more general form of bivariate
                 interaction function did not improve the likelihood of
                 generating the observed maps. On- and off-center beta RGCs are
                 therefore likely to be positioned subject only to homotypic
                 constraints and the physical constraint that no two somas of
                 opposite type can occupy the same position.",

                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight

                 computer codes and a precise description of how the code was
                 applied to the data. A brief history of this approach is

                 is now called reproducible research in computational data
                 analysis oriented fields like statistics and signal

                 manner across the surface of the retina. Indeed, the existence
                 of such regularity amongst a population of neurons, termed a
                 retinal mosaic, may be a defining feature of functionally
                 independent types of retinal neuron. We have examined the
                 spatial distribution of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the
                 ferret retina both in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and in the
                 ganglion cell layer (GCL) to determine whether the cells in
                 each layer form an independent retinal mosaic as evidence of
                 whether they should be considered as two separate types.
                 Ferret retinas contain approximately 1,900 dopaminergic
                 amacrine cells, of which 27\% are located in the GCL, and the
                 rest in the INL. Based on analysis of their Voronoi domains as
                 well as autocorrelation analysis and tests for complete
                 spatial randomness, we found that the distribution of INL
                 cells was statistically regular, while that of the GCL cells
                 was not. However, by using cross-correlation analysis, these
                 two groups of cells were found to be spatially dependent: an
                 exclusion zone was detected in the cross-correlogram of
                 roughly the same size as that found in the autocorrelograms of
                 both INL and GCL cells. Such a pattern would be expected if
                 dopaminergic amacrine cells in the INL and GCL were members of
                 a single regular population differing only in their somatic
                 depth. By using computer simulations, we tested this
                 hypothesis directly, confirming that a random assignment of
                 27\% from the total population produces cross-correlograms
                 that are indistinguishable from those of the biological
                 mosaics. We conclude, therefore, that the cells in the two
                 layers form a single functional population; those in the GCL
                 appear to be misplaced. Somatic positioning with respect to

                 formation of these mosaics. Most evidence to date suggests
                 that homotypic constraints within a type of neuron are
                 dominant, and that heterotypic interactions between different
                 types of neuron are rare. In an analysis of macaque H1 and H2

                 cells of that same type and also to cells of different types.
                 Every neuron studied was found to be nonrandomly positioned:
                 Cells of a particular type were evenly spaced. However, all
                 cells were positioned randomly with respect to members of the
                 other cell classes. This was true even when the cells were
                 known to be synaptically connected. It is consistent with a
                 concept of developmental pattern formation in which (i) the
                 number of cells of a particular type and their laminar
                 distribution are specified, and (ii) the final spatial
                 position of each cell is controlled exclusively by a rule that
                 prevents cells of the same type from being positioned close to
                 each other. This sequence would imply that a cell's final
                 position is independent of the cell's position at the time of
                 its specification, and we suggest a reason why, in laminar
                 structures containing many cell types, it might be desirable
                 for this to be so.",

  abstract    = "The avian retina possesses one of the most sophisticated cone
                 photoreceptor systems among vertebrates. Birds have five types
                 of cones including four single cones, which support
                 tetrachromatic color vision and a double cone, which is
                 thought to mediate achromatic motion perception. Despite this
                 richness, very little is known about the spatial organization
                 of avian cones and its adaptive significance. Here we show
                 that the five cone types of the chicken independently tile the
                 retina as highly ordered mosaics with a characteristic spacing
                 between cones of the same type. Measures of topological order
                 indicate that double cones are more highly ordered than single
                 cones, possibly reflecting their posited role in motion
                 detection. Although cones show spacing interactions that are
                 cell type-specific, all cone types use the same
                 density-dependent yardstick to measure intercone distance. We
                 propose a simple developmental model that can account for
                 these observations. We also show that a single parameter, the
                 global regularity index, defines the regularity of all five
                 cone mosaics. Lastly, we demonstrate similar cone
                 distributions in three additional avian species, suggesting
                 that these patterning principles are universal among birds.
                 Since regular photoreceptor spacing is critical for uniform
                 sampling of visual space, the cone mosaics of the avian retina
                 represent an elegant example of the emergence of adaptive
                 global patterning secondary to simple local interactions
                 between individual photoreceptors. Our results indicate that
                 the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the avian
                 retina's various adaptations for enhanced color discrimination
                 also acted to fine-tune its spatial sampling of color and
                 luminance.",

  abstract    = "The R7 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila retina are
                 ultraviolet sensitive and are thought to mediate color
                 discrimination and polarized light detection. In addition,
                 there is growing evidence that the color sensitivity of the R8
                 cell within an individual ommatidium is regulated by a genetic
                 switch that depends on the type of R7 cell adjacent to it.
                 Here we examine the organization of the two major types of R7
                 cells by three different rigorous statistical methods and
                 present evidence that they are arranged randomly and
                 independently. First, we performed L-function analyses to test
                 whether the organization of R7 cells (and the relationship
                 between them) is regular, clustered, or completely spatially
                 random. Next, we used generalized linear mixed models to test
                 whether the proportion of R7 cell neighbors differs from their
                 prevalence within the eye as a whole. Finally, we conducted a
                 series of simulations to test whether the proportion of R7
                 cell neighbors differs from that in a random simulation. In
                 each case, we found evidence that the organization of the two
                 types of R7 cells is random and independent, suggesting that
                 R7 cells in neighboring ommatidia are unlikely to interact and
                 influence each other's identity and may be determined
                 stochastically in a cell-autonomous manner. Compared with
                 traditional lineage or inductive mechanisms, this may
                 represent a novel mechanism of cell fate determination based
                 on noisy or stochastic gene expression in which the
                 differentiation of an individual R7 cell is a random event but
                 the proportions of R7 cell subtypes are regulated.",
