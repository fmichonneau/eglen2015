% Bivariate spatial point patterns . . . by S. J. Eglen

Dear Christophe,

We thank you and the reviewers for the positive comments on the 
manuscript.


Please see below for my response to each reviewer.  Comments from
each reviewer are numbered and indented below.  Changes made to the
manuscript are highlighted in blue and annotated in the manuscript
with the corresponding number.  e.g. R2.5 refers to point 5 of referee
2.


## Reviewer 1

> 1.1) eq. 2: correct equation is $\sqrt{K_{12}/\pi}$

> 1.2) Fig. 3: I wonder why there is no confidence interval. It will gives
> an estimate of d_\mbox{min}.

> 1.3) Choice of d_\mbox{min} is questionnable. You mainly described an
> hard-core process (or Strauss process). You may find the set of
> d, the exclusion distance compatible with your data. Compatible
> means that the process does not go out the confidence interval
> (at 5% level for example).


> 1.4) Fig 4 since we mostly print inblack and white, I personnaly
> prefer different symbols than different colors.

> 1.5) Why do you present the results for functional independence ?

> 1.6) According to Fig. 6 you reject random for distances between 100
> and 150. Please discuss.

> 1.7) In order to avoid confusion among readers, please precise
> difference between independence and random labelling. 

> 1.8) Fig. 7: By simulating CSR, you may construct confidence interval.

> 1.9) You may be interested to read paper like Illian, J., Benson,
> E., Crawford, J., & Staines, H. (2006). Principal component analysis
> for spatial point processes—assessing the appropriateness of the
> approach in an ecological context. In Case studies in spatial point
> process modeling (pp. 135-150). Springer New York.

## Reviewer 2

> 2.1) The introduction needs more background. As it is the text jumps
> from the fact that the retina does unique computations to (x,y,z)
> positions, and doesn’t explain why we should care about the latter.

> 2.2) The title is a bit too general considering the paper’s
> contents. I’d replace “in the visual system” with “in the retina”,
> since no other structure is mentioned.

> 2.3) Confidence bands are missing from fig 3 and fig 7B.

> 2.4) I know very little about how the retina develops, but maybe the
> author could explain why complete spatial randomness would be a
> reasonable null model? Somas are to a good approximation 2D
> objects, but whole neurons aren’t. Dendrites and axons need to
> be packed in there as well, doesn’t that constrain where somas
> can be?

> 2.5) I’m not sure to what extent this belongs in a review paper, but
> second-order statistics such as Ripley’s K function become much
> harder to use when you can’t assume a uniform intensity function.
> Does uniform density really holds in the retinal mosaics the author
> examines?

> 2.6) I appreciated that the author put an entire R package on github
> for easy distribution, and docker sounds extremely useful. My only
> worry is that we rely on private companies (github, docker) that
> might stop providing free services any time. Perhaps reproducibility
> would require public, durable infrastructure but that’s not a
> problem for this review to solve.
